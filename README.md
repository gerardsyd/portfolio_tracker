# Portfolio position tracker
Tracks stock, funds, crypto asset portfolio including gains / losses, dividends etc using python. Can track any assets listed on [yfinance](https://github.com/ranaroussi/yfinance), [investpy](https://github.com/alvarobartt/investpy) and [binance](https://github.com/sammchardy/python-binance)

See my [Medium post](https://medium.com/@gerard_syd/python-stock-portfolio-tracker-4bf6d082f564) for information on how to use:


## Update 24 August 2020
- Added support for crypto with conversion into AUD, EUR, GBP, USD and ZAR (using Binance API)

## Installation
- Clone the repository and install using pipfile (if using pipenv) or requirements.txt (for other virtual environments)
- Create two new folders called 'logs' and 'data' under the parent folder (if these do not already exist)
- If you want to use the crypto pricing functionality, sign up for a Binance account and get the API key / secret and store them in a .env file as follows:
    BINANCE_API_KEY='{your API Key}'
    BINANCE_API_SECRET='{your API Secret}'

## Known bugs
- If quantity / price / fees are blank when providing trade data, portfolio calculations do not work as expected (when using Load Portfolio)

##To be built / implemented
- Add trades section to include dividends
- dashboard for each stock to include performance over time incl buys, sells, divs; trade history; current position / p&l; overview position / p&l
- Dashboard for portfolio: change in val over time; overview position / p&l
- allow hiding certain stocks on portfolio + recalculate position
- Automate entering trade data?
